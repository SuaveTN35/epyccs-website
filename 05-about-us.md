## OUR STORY

### Section Headline:
## Why We Started EPYC

### Content:
EPYC Courier Service was founded with a simple mission: to provide Southern California businesses with a courier service they can truly depend on.

We saw an industry full of missed deadlines, lost packages, and frustrated customers. We knew there had to be a better way. So we built it.

Today, EPYC serves healthcare providers, law firms, corporations, and businesses across Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, and the Inland Empire. From urgent medical specimens to time-sensitive court filings, we deliver with precision, professionalism, and care.

Our name says it all — **EPYC** stands for the epic level of service we bring to every single delivery.
